For Sequential, Perceptual, and Diverging colors you can reverse the palette with the toggle at the very bottom.


## Limitations

1. This only works in Qlik Sense Feb 2018 and newer.
2. When coloring by dimension and 'Persistent colors' is selected, the color palette changes the order of the colors. Some of the palettes place colors next to each other on purpose. I haven't seen a clean workaround.
